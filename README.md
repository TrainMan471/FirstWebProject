# FirstWebProject
Code for Code Louisville Project: Version 1.1 should be done July 22.

NOTE: The Index.Html file is in the slick folder. For some reason, the file path is working in this way. Will fix at a later date, but for now
 now website is functioning. Also, the code on this repo will *NOT* be ready for review until Friday July 22 at noon.

EDIT: Files path have now been corrected.

UPDATE: Added a Template file, Index.ejs. Used this file to insert and display data using mongodb.
Will update it even further in the future, and stylize it as well.

Used Angular.js to make a table where client can rate something, and the number of stars he rates
appears on the web page; Have not found a way as of yet to keep it displayed on the webpage, but
pretty certain you use mongoDB.

As of right now, The website functions, with a few minor bugs here and there. (Mainly
  the angular app that was created.).

*IMPORTANT: I did a lot of building and tearing down in the beginning, and uploaded a lot of files
to GitHub I had not intended to. I will list the files needed to be reviewed.

*List of Code to focus on for reviewing:
1)The Entire Static Directory
2)views/index.ejs
3)package.json
4)server.js

Everything else can be ignored, as I did not end up using it for the website/
