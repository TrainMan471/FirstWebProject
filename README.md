Code for Code Louisville Project: Version 1.1 should be done July 22.

NOTE: The Index.Html file is in the slick folder. For some reason, the file path is working in this way. Will fix at a later date, but for now 
 now website is functioning. Also, the code on this repo will *NOT* be ready for review until Friday July 22 at noon.
